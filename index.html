 <p> <b>Aristotle</b>,a philosopher and scientist born 384 BCE, Stagira, Chalcidice, Greece. His father, Nicomachus, was the physician of Amyntas III, king of Macedonia and grandfather of Alexander the Great. After his father’s death in 367, Aristotle migrated to Athens, where he joined the Academy of Plato. He remained there for 20 years as Plato’s pupil and colleague. When Plato died about 348, his nephew Speusippus became head of the Academy, and Aristotle left Athens. He migrated to Assus, a city on the northwestern coast of Anatolia (in present-day Turkey), where Hermias, a graduate of the Academy, was ruler. While in Assus and during the subsequent few years when he lived in the city of Mytilene on the island of Lesbos, Aristotle carried out extensive scientific research, particularly in zoology and marine biology. This work was summarized in a book later known, misleadingly, as The History of Animals, to which Aristotle added two short treatises, On the Parts of Animals and On the Generation of Animals. In 343 or 342 Aristotle was summoned by Philip II to the Macedonian capital at Pella to act as tutor to Philip’s 13-year-old son, the future Alexander the Great. Little is known of the content of Aristotle’s instruction; although the Rhetoric to Alexander was included in the Aristotelian corpus for centuries, it is now commonly regarded as a forgery. By 326 Alexander had made himself master of an empire that stretched from the Danube to the Indus and included Libya and Egypt. Ancient sources report that during his campaigns Alexander arranged for biological specimens to be sent to his tutor from all parts of Greece and Asia Minor.</p>

  	<li>Aristotle married Pythias and had a daughter, Pythias, named after her mother. After the death of his first wife, Aristotle fell in love with Herpyllis who was a former slave of Pythias. Herpyllis was the mother of Nicomachus.</li>
  	<li>While Aristotle made some exceptional discoveries during his lifetime, he wasn’t always correct. According to Aristotle, the heart is the center of intelligence, not the brain. He also thought that the gender of goats depends on the direction of wind flow.</li>
  	<li>He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books.</li>
  	<li>Aristotle composed two types of works: the first was destined for the general public and thus was far more comprehensible, while the other was designed for students and teachers of philosophy.</li>
  	<li>He wrote many books and kept notes to help teach his students. Unfortunately, most were lost and only one-third of his writings have survived.</li>
